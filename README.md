## Background

This is a simple todo app in React.js. Most of the code is implemented for you, and you just need to fill in the missing features requested below. It is simple enough that you can follow what I did and fill in the missing features. If there are any problems/questions don't hesitate to ask Chris or I.


## Setup

Please make sure you have npm installed and node. I am using
npm 3.8.6 and node v6.0.0.

To get the project installed and running do the following in the console:

- npm install
- npm start
- goto http://localhost:3000

If you have any problems let Chris or I know.


## Requested Features

1. The client has requested that they would like to filter the list of todos by active or completed. Currently they can filter by all (default).

2. The client has requested to be able to delete the a todo from the list.

3. (Bonus) If you have time, the client requests a low priority item: being able to remove/delete all the completed todos. (not required)
